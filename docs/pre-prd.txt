# Stairway Sprint – Mini Game Design Document

## 1. High-Level Concept
**Title (working):** Stairway Sprint  
**Elevator Pitch:** Race down multiple stair lanes to rescue runaway strollers and protect VIPs from assassins, while avoiding hazards.  
**Genre & Platform:** 2D arcade action game for web/mobile using Phaser 3 (JavaScript/TypeScript).

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Spawn Event**  
   - Baby strollers or hazards (lawnmowers, crates) randomly enter one of 3–5 stair lanes from the top.  
2. **Player Reaction**  
   - Player moves down a selected lane to intercept; use arrow keys or touch/swipe to switch lanes.  
3. **Outcome**  
   - Stroller captured = +1 point  
   - Hazard collision = –1 life or –2 points  
4. **VIP Threat**  
   - When a VIP (celebrity/president/pope) appears, an assassin arrives too. Player must shoot with spacebar or tap.  
5. **End Conditions**  
   - 0 lives = Game Over  
   - Reach score/time target = Victory

## 3. Core Mechanics
- **Lanes:** 3–5 vertical stair lanes  
- **Entities:**  
  - *Stroller:* moves downward at constant speed  
  - *Hazard:* random speed; collision damages player  
  - *VIP & Assassin:* paired spawn event; assassin must be shot  
- **Player Controls:**  
  - Left/right arrow or swipe to switch lanes  
  - Spacebar or tap to shoot  
- **Physics:** Phaser Arcade Physics for collisions and movement :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Scoring & Lives:**  
  | Event          | Score / Life       |
  |----------------|--------------------|
  | Stroller saved | +1 point           |
  | Hazard hit     | –1 life / –2 points|
  | VIP shot       | +5 points          |
  | VIP missed     | –2 lives           |

  Start with 3–5 lives.

## 4. Art & Audio
- **Graphics:**  
  - Top-down sprites: strollers, hazards, VIPs, assassin, player  
  - Staircase background via tilemap or repeating sprites  
- **Audio:**  
  - Sounds for rescuing, collision, shooting, background music  
- **Animations:**  
  - Movement, collision reaction, shooting animation frames

## 5. Difficulty Progression
- Increasing spawn rate of strollers/hazards every 30 seconds  
- VIP events become more frequent (every 60 seconds)  
- Score milestones trigger visual/audio feedback (e.g., at 10, 25, 50 points)

## 6. Technical Stack
- **Engine:** Phaser 3.x (MIT license)—supports Canvas/WebGL, Arcade Physics :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Scenes:**  
  - `PreloadScene`: preload assets  
  - `MainMenuScene`: title/menu  
  - `GameScene`: main gameplay  
  - `GameOverScene`: end screen  
- **Lifecycle methods:** `preload()`, `create()`, `update()`  
- **Game Configuration:** Include renderer type, canvas size, physics settings, and scene list as shown in Phaser tutorials :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

## 7. MVP Feature Checklist
- [ ] Stair lane rendering  
- [ ] Stroller spawning  
- [ ] Player lane movement  
- [ ] Collision detection + scoring/lives  
- [ ] Hazard spawn & penalty  
- [ ] VIP + assassin logic  
- [ ] Shooting mechanic  
- [ ] Difficulty ramp  
- [ ] UI elements (score/lives) and sound  
- [ ] Menu & game over scenes

## 8. Next Steps (AI-Prompt Examples)
1. **Initialize lanes & spawning:**  
   > "In `GameScene.create()`, set up 4 lanes and timed stroller spawn every 2 seconds."
2. **Add player controls:**  
   > "Add keyboard and touch input to switch lanes with boundary checks."
3. **Implement collision logic:**  
   > "In `update()`, detect overlaps between player and entities, update score or lives."
4. **Create VIP & assassin:**  
   > "Generate paired VIP and assassin spawn function; implement shooting and outcome handling."
5. **Build progression & UI:**  
   > "Add timer-based difficulty increase and UI elements for score and lives."
